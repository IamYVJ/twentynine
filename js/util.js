// util.js — Small shared helpers. No game logic, no network, no engine.
//
// The module layout in the brief gives this file "storage, ids, formatting",
// and as of checkpoint 8 all three are here. The DOM helpers and the
// formatters came first because js/ui.js needed them; the storage half waited
// for js/net.js, which is the first thing that actually reads it. Writing it
// earlier would have meant writing it against an imagined caller and testing
// it against nothing.
//
// EVERY KEY THIS FILE WRITES IS PREFIXED `twentynine.`, and the prefix is not
// cosmetic. These games are served from one origin as sibling paths on GitHub
// Pages, so `sequence`, `courtpiece` and this share a single localStorage.
// js/state.js binds a seat to the clientId below; two games sharing one key
// would hand a player the wrong identity in the wrong room.
//
// WHY el() AND clear() ARE HERE AND NOT IN ui.js
//   Because js/main.js needs clear() too, for the one node ui.js must never
//   touch: the #announce live region lives OUTSIDE #app precisely so that
//   render()'s clear(root) cannot destroy it, and the controller that copies
//   text into it is therefore not the renderer. Two callers, so it is shared.

 * null/undefined/false, which are skipped so a conditional child can be written
 * inline as `cond && el(...)`.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NO `html:` ESCAPE HATCH, which is the one difference from
 * sequence's version of this function. Every string that reaches this UI is
 * either a player's own name or a log line built from one, and both arrive over
 * a data channel from a peer nobody has authenticated. sequence has an `html`
 * branch and gets away with it because nothing untrusted is ever passed to it;
 * that is a property of its call sites, not of the helper, and properties of
 * call sites are exactly what stops being true later. Text goes through
 * createTextNode, always, so there is no path from a peer's name to innerHTML.
 *
 * A boolean `true` renders as a bare attribute (`disabled`), and false/null/
 * undefined omit it entirely — so `disabled: !canPlay` is safe either way, where
 * `setAttribute('disabled', false)` would have disabled the button.

// What the live region says
//
// For a long time the answer was "room code copied", and only that: app.announce
// in js/main.js had exactly one assignment, inside copyCode(). Everything the
// engine had to say — every bid, every trick, every deal scored — went into
// pub.log, was rendered beautifully into a drawer nobody could open, and was
// never spoken. A player using a screen reader could hear that they had copied
// a code and then nothing at all for the whole match.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN util.js AND NOT IN main.js. main.js touches the DOM, the
// transport and localStorage in its first twenty lines, so it cannot be
// imported by the headless harness and nothing in it can be swept. This is the
// one part of the announcement with a decision in it, so it is pulled out here
// as a pure function of (what we said last, the log now) and swept over whole
// matches in scripts/test-engine.mjs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A log entry's identity. Not the index: the engine caps the log at 60 lines
// and drops from the front, so indices shift under us mid-match and an
// index-based cursor would re-announce the whole drawer every time the cap
// bit.
//
// JSON.stringify OF THE THREE FIELDS, rather than joining them with a
// separator character. Engine sentences are built out of player names, so any
// printable separator is only safe until somebody works out which one it is:
// with '|', a player calling themselves "3|bid" could forge another line's key
// and make the real line go unannounced. JSON escapes its own delimiters, so
// there is no character to guess, and the source stays free of control bytes
// that break every text tool that touches this file.
const logKey = (l) => JSON.stringify([l.deal, l.kind, l.text]);

/**
 * What to announce, given the log and where we had got to in it.
 *
 * Returns `{ cursor, text }`. The cursor is opaque — hand it straight back on
 * the next call. `text` is '' when there is no news, and a caller that gets ''
 * should LEAVE THE REGION ALONE rather than clearing it: a live region that is
 * emptied and refilled says everything twice.
 *
 * THE FIRST CALL ANNOUNCES ONE LINE, NOT SIXTY. Joining a match in deal
 * fourteen hands you a log with the whole match in it, and reading all of it
 * aloud is worse than reading none of it. Same when the cursor has fallen off
 * the end of the cap — we are behind, and the useful thing is the newest line,
 * not a recap.
 *
 * Several lines at once is the normal case rather than the exceptional one:
 * the engine finishes a trick and scores a deal inside a single tick, so one
 * push can carry "Dev takes it" and "Round 4: Ana 40, Ben 0" together. Both
 * get said, in the order they happened.
 *
 * ONE ASSUMPTION, AND IT IS CHECKED RATHER THAN BELIEVED: the engine never
 * writes the same line twice in a row. If it did, the cursor could not tell
 * "nothing happened" from "it happened again", and the second one would be
 * swallowed. scripts/test-engine.mjs asserts no two adjacent entries share a
 * key across every match it plays, so if that ever stops being true the suite
 * says so here rather than the app going quiet on somebody.

// thing that gets a hand back after a battery dies.
//
// WHY IT CANNOT BE THE DISPLAY NAME. Anyone holding a four-character room code
// can connect and type any name they like — the scoreboard is public by
// design, so every name at the table is readable by everybody at it. A seat
// that can be reclaimed by naming it can be stolen by naming it. The tempting
// objection is that a peer-to-peer host only ever hears from the same sofa; it
// doesn't. PeerJS signalling goes through a broker on the public internet and
// the data channel falls back to a public relay. See the header of js/net.js.
//
// A TICKET, NOT A CREDENTIAL, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS WORTH BEING PRECISE ABOUT.
// It authenticates nothing. Anybody who learns one can take that seat, and
// nothing in this app can tell them apart from its owner. What it buys is that
// learning one requires guessing 128 bits rather than reading a name off the
// screen. So it is handled with the care that implies and no more: never
// rendered, never logged, never put in a URL, never sent to anything except
// the machine running the game. Note what that rules out — it must not appear
// in publicState(), and this game's publicState() does not even publish player
// ids, so there is nothing on the wire to correlate it with.
//
// GENERATED ONCE AND NEVER REGENERATED. There is no rotation and no expiry,
// because a fresh id is indistinguishable from a different device: the host
// would refuse the reclaim and lock somebody out of their own seat mid-deal.
// This is also why "Clear cache & reload" touches Cache Storage and service
// workers ONLY, and never localStorage. That button and this constant are one
// decision written in two files.
//
// The character class matches validClientId() in js/guards.js exactly (8–64 of
