// ============================================================================
// net.js — The peer-to-peer transport. WebRTC via PeerJS, host-authoritative.
//
// SHAPE: A STAR, NEVER A MESH.
//   The host creates a Peer whose id is derived from the four-character room
//   code, so a joiner can reconstruct the host's address from the code alone
//   and no lookup service is needed. Every joiner opens exactly one
//   DataConnection to the host; joiners never talk to each other. The host runs
//   the only GameEngine that exists, validates everything, and sends each
//   device the public state plus only that device's own hand.
//
//   Twenty-nine seats exactly four, so that is one host and up to three
//   spokes, plus any watching screens. A mesh would need a consensus rule for
//   who dealt. A star
//   needs neither, at the price of the host being a single point of failure —
//   which is what the engine snapshot in js/util.js is for.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SIGNALLING, AND WHY A CACHED PWA STILL NEEDS THE INTERNET.
//   PeerJS needs a "broker" (a signalling server) ONCE, to carry the WebRTC
//   handshake. After that, game traffic goes device to device. The default
//   broker is PeerJS's free public cloud, so the initial handshake needs the
//   internet to be reachable even though the app shell itself loads from cache.
//
//   The consequence worth stating plainly: a room code is an address on a
//   PUBLIC broker, not a LAN-local one. peerIdForCode() is derivable by
//   anybody, and there are only 32^4 ≈ 1M codes. Everything in js/guards.js,
//   and the clientId rule in js/state.js, exists because of that sentence.
//
//   FOR FULLY-OFFLINE LAN PLAY: run a PeerServer on the LAN,
//       npx peer --port 9000 --key peerjs --path /twentynine
//   and point BROKER_CONFIG at it:
//       export const BROKER_CONFIG = {
//         host: '192.168.1.50', port: 9000, path: '/twentynine',
//         key: 'peerjs', secure: false,
//       };
//   Every device at the table must use the same broker config to find the
//   others.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ZERO DEPENDENCIES AND A PEERJS TRANSPORT ARE NOT IN CONFLICT.
//   PeerJS arrives as a UMD bundle from a CDN <script> tag in index.html and is
//   read off `window.Peer`. It is never imported, so package.json still has no
//   `dependencies` key, there is no build step, and nothing third-party is
//   vendored into this repo. The cost is that the one thing in this app which
//   can be missing while everything else works is the transport — hence
//   peerAvailable() below, and the inert transport that reports it as a normal
//   error instead of throwing out of a click handler.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NAT TRAVERSAL — WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.
//   newPeer() passes no `config`, so PeerJS's DEFAULT iceServers apply: Google
//   STUN plus two public TURN relays run by peerjs.com, with credentials baked
//   into the library and shared with every PeerJS app on the internet.
//
//   So this is not LAN-only and never was. STUN hole-punching connects two
//   ordinary home routers on different ISPs, and when it fails WebRTC relays
//   through peerjs.com. Keeping the default is deliberate — six people in six
//   different houses is a normal way to play this game — with three
//   consequences the rest of the code has to be honest about:
//
//     1. A table is reachable from anywhere by anyone holding the code. That is
//        why a seat mid-deal belongs to a clientId and not to a display name
//        (js/state.js addPlayer), and why this host applies the same bounds to
//        a peer that a server would (js/guards.js).
//     2. Cross-network ICE shows each player's public IP to the others. There
//        is no way around that in a peer-to-peer game; a server transport is
//        the answer for anyone who minds, and js/config.js holds the seam.
//     3. A relayed game depends on somebody else's infrastructure staying up.
//        The DataChannel is DTLS-encrypted end to end, so a relay forwards
//        ciphertext it cannot read — availability is the exposure here, not
//        confidentiality.
//
//   To make this LAN-only, pass `config: { iceServers: [] }` in newPeer(): with
//   no STUN and no relay, only host candidates are gathered.
//
//   Connections still fail silently. Symmetric NAT with the relay blocked,
//   "client isolation" guest Wi-Fi, and some corporate networks all produce the
//   same thing: the broker cheerfully says the host exists, and then the data
//   channel never comes up and nobody errors. That silence is why a joinHost()
//   caller needs a deadline of its own — see the note on joinHost().
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SEAT RECLAIM: WHICH HALF OF IT IS HERE.
//   The brief makes seat reclaim a headline of this checkpoint, and it is worth
//   being exact about the split, because most of the mechanism is not in this
//   file.
//
//   js/state.js owns the RULE: addPlayer() matches on clientId and on nothing
//   else, in any phase, and hands back the seat with its hand, its bid and its
//   running total intact. A name is never a seat ticket.
//
//   This file owns the three transport facts that make the rule reachable:
//
//     1. THE ADDRESS SURVIVES. The host's peer id is derived from the room
//        code, so a host that reloads, or blips off Wi-Fi, comes back at the
//        same address. Reconnecting is therefore just joining again, and
//        nothing has to be renegotiated or re-shared.
//     2. THE TICKET TRAVELS. joinHost() sends the JOIN frame itself, exactly
//        once per connection, carrying the clientId. A caller cannot forget to.
//     3. ONE CONNECTION IS ONE IDENTITY. A connection that has already
//        announced a clientId may repeat it, and may not change it — see the
//        note in the host's data handler for what the alternative allows.
//
//   What this file must NOT do is decide anything about seats. It does not
//   import js/state.js, has no idea how many seats exist, and never refuses a
//   connection because "the table is full": a disconnected player coming back
//   mid-match arrives on a brand-new connection to a table that is, by
//   definition, already full. Turning them away at the door would make reclaim
//   impossible at exactly the table where it matters.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE.
//   * No discovery / open-table list. PeerJS's listAllPeers() only answers on a
//     broker configured with allow_discovery, which the public cloud is not, so
//     it would be a feature that works on nobody's phone. Typing four
//     characters is the join flow.
//   * No game rules of any kind. Every frame this file admits still goes
//     through js/intents.js and then the engine, which checks the phase, the
//     turn, the seat, the card and the owner for itself. Deleting this file's
//     validation would not make one illegal move legal — see the header of
//     js/guards.js, which says the same thing from the other side.
//   * No WebSocket transport to a server. js/config.js holds blank SERVER_URL
//     and SERVER_HEALTH and js/intents.js is already the shared dispatcher both
//     transports would call — that is the seam, and it is the part worth having
//     in advance. A socket client that has never been run against a server is
//     not a seam, it is untested code that looks tested.
//   * No turn timers and no heartbeat. Turn timers are out of scope for v1 by
//     the brief. A heartbeat would only tell us what 'close' already tells us,
//     a few seconds sooner, at the price of traffic on every phone in the room
//     for the whole match.

// here as builder/reader pairs for one reason: a frame that is written in one
// file and read in another is two opinions about a format, and they drift. The
// pair cannot.
//
// Seven types is the whole protocol on top of the intents. Anything else that
// arrives is handed to the caller's onData, where applyGameIntent() gets a
// look at it and an unrecognised type is a no-op — which is what lets a newer
// client talk to an older host without either of them crashing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE FOURTH ONE EXISTS, WHEN THREE WAS THE POINT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// It was three, and the fourth is not a convenience. A seat is claimed by
// clientId, and a clientId is per-DEVICE, not per-tab: two tabs of the same
// browser read the same localStorage and therefore dial with the same ticket.
// The second one reclaims the seat and the host retires the first one's
// channel, which is correct and is the whole reconnect story — a phone that
// comes back out of a tunnel is exactly this.
//
// What is NOT correct is what the first tab then does. A closed channel is
// indistinguishable from a channel that died, so it redials; redialling wins
// the seat back; and the tab that just took it gets retired in turn. Two tabs
// will do that to each other until one of them is closed, and neither shows
// anything but a spinner while it happens.
//
// The host cannot tell the two cases apart — a dying phone and a second tab
// look identical from here, and any test that tried (timing, user agent, how
// recently the seat spoke) would guess wrong on somebody's train. So this
// frame does not try. It carries no decision, only a fact the OLD connection
// cannot observe for itself: you were not dropped, you were superseded. What
// to do about that is the client's business, and js/main.js's answer is to
// stop redialling and say so.
//
// It is best-effort by construction. It is sent immediately before the channel
// is closed, so a real DataChannel can lose it in flight; when that happens the
// behaviour degrades to exactly what it was before this frame existed, which is
// why the guard is here and not the only thing standing between two tabs and a
// loop.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AND THE TWO GOODBYES, WHICH ARE THE SAME ARGUMENT FROM EACH END
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A channel that closes says nothing about WHY, and both ends guess the same
// way: it was an accident, so wait for it to be undone. That guess is right
// for a tunnel and wrong for a person who pressed LEAVE, and it is wrong in a
// way that costs the people who stayed.
//
//   LEAVE      A player going on purpose. Without it the host hears a close,
//              marks the seat disconnected, and holds every one of that seat's
//              turns for the offline grace before a bot covers it — ten seconds
//              a turn, for the rest of the match, waiting on somebody who has
//              said they are not coming.
//
//   HOSTLEFT   The host going on purpose, taking the engine with it. Without
//              it every client climbs the whole reconnect ladder first, which
//              is most of half a minute of "reconnecting…" to a table that was
//              put down deliberately and may be picked up again later.
//
// Like REPLACED, each is a fact the other end cannot observe, carries nothing,
// decides nothing, and is best-effort: sent as the channel is about to close,
// so it can be lost, and when it is lost what happens is exactly what happened
// before either frame existed. Neither grants anything. A LEAVE can only ever
// vacate the sender's own seat, which closing the channel would do anyway, and
// a HOSTLEFT from a table that is still there is a host choosing to stop
// talking to you, which it could do without a frame.

 * second time — otherwise the caller would be told the same seat had gone
 * twice, and the second telling would overwrite "left" with "disconnected".
 *
 * Note what a watcher does NOT change. It is an ordinary connection in every
