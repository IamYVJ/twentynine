// ============================================================================
// main.js — the controller, and the only impure file in the app.
//
// Every other module was kept clean of something on purpose, and all of that
// something ends up here:
//
//   js/state.js   has no clock.      This file calls tick().
//   js/ui.js      has no state.      This file owns `app` and hands it over.
//   js/net.js     has no game rules. This file routes frames to the engine.
//   js/bot.js     has no timer.      This file pumps the driver.
//
// So this is where the interesting failures live, and it is written defensively
// on the assumption that it is the file most likely to be wrong.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO MODES, ONE VIEW MODEL
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A device is either the HOST — it holds the only GameEngine that exists and
// answers everybody — or a CLIENT, which holds no engine at all and draws
// whatever the host last sent it. `app.pub` / `app.priv` mean exactly the same
// thing in both cases, which is what lets js/ui.js be written without knowing
// or caring which mode it is running in.
//
// The asymmetry is entirely in how an intent travels:
//
//   HOST:    intent -> applyGameIntent(engine, HOST_ID, …) -> push to everyone
//   CLIENT:  intent -> net.send(...) -> ... -> host does the above -> onState
//
// A client NEVER applies its own move optimistically. It sends and waits. That
// costs a round trip of latency on every tap and buys the thing the brief is
// most insistent about: there is exactly one opinion about what is legal, it
// lives on the host, and no screen can ever disagree with it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// isHost IS NOT isOwner
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Kept apart here the same way js/ui.js and js/intents.js keep them apart.
// `app.isHost` says this tab runs the engine. `priv.isOwner` says this player
// holds the controls. This file gates NOTHING on isHost except which code path
// an intent takes; every permission question is the engine's, asked by passing
// an actor id and letting _isOwner() answer.
