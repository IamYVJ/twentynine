// ============================================================================
// sw.js — the service worker. Offline support, and nothing else.
//
// AT THE REPOSITORY ROOT, NOT IN js/, and that is forced rather than chosen. A
// worker's default scope is the directory it is served from, so a worker at
// ./js/sw.js could only ever control ./js/* — it would never see a navigation
// to the page. Widening the scope needs a `Service-Worker-Allowed` response
// header, and GitHub Pages does not let you set headers. So: root.
//
// It is also NOT a module. `type: 'module'` workers are supported now but the
// registration in index.html does not ask for one, and importing js/util.js in
// here would be a mistake anyway — see the next paragraph.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS: THIS WORKER NEVER WRITES TO THE CACHE
// EXCEPT DURING install.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There is no runtime caching, no stale-while-revalidate, no "cache it if the
// fetch succeeded". The precache is written once per version and read from
// thereafter. That single decision is what makes three separate hazards
// impossible rather than merely unlikely:
//
//   1. THE BEACON. Nothing cross-origin is ever stored — not the PeerJS bundle
//      from unpkg, not the fonts, and above all not anything on the signalling
//      broker. A cached signalling response is a peer connection that dials a
//      conversation which ended yesterday, and the symptom is a room code that
//      "works" and then sits there forever. The origin check in the fetch
//      handler below refuses to even respond to those, and with no write path
//      there is nothing to disable.
//
//   2. THE HEALTH PROBE. js/config.js warns that a cached "yes" from a
//      /health endpoint strands the app in server mode while the machine is
//      off. v1 has no server, but the day SERVER_HEALTH is filled in, this
//      worker is already safe by construction and nobody has to remember.
//
//   3. THE HALF-STALE SHELL. Every byte the app runs comes from one cache
//      written by one install, so js/ui.js can never be the new version while
//      js/state.js is the old one. Mixed-version module graphs fail in ways
//      that look like logic bugs, and they are the reason the "Clear cache &
//      reload" button exists at all.
//

// BUMP THIS WHENEVER ANY FILE IN SHELL CHANGES — not just when the list of
// files changes, but when their CONTENTS do.
//
// The reason is the install step below: caches.addAll() is a no-op against a
// cache that already exists under this name, so a redeploy that keeps the name
// keeps serving the old bytes forever. The name IS the version number; there
// is nothing else in a service worker that can carry one.
//
// The browser re-fetches this file on navigation and reinstalls when its bytes
// differ, so changing this string is also what triggers the update.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS A CONTENT HASH AND NOT 'v1', 'v2', 'v3'
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// It was a hand-incremented version, and it sat at v1 through a round of fixes
// to six of the files below. Nothing failed. The suite was green, the bugs
// were fixed in the repository, and every returning visitor would have kept
// the broken build indefinitely — because the only thing standing between a
// fix and the people it was for was somebody remembering to edit this line.
//
// A hand-written version number cannot be checked: no test can know whether
// you MEANT the bytes to change. A fingerprint of the bytes can. This is the
// sha256 of every path in SHELL, in sorted order, with line endings normalised
// so that a checkout on Windows and a checkout on Linux agree.
//
// scripts/test-engine.mjs recomputes it and fails if it does not match, and
// `npm run stamp` rewrites this one line with the answer. So the rule is no
// longer "remember to bump this" — it is "the suite tells you, and one command
// does it". DO NOT EDIT THE TWELVE CHARACTERS BY HAND to make a red suite go
// green: the number is a claim about the bytes of twenty-one other files, and
// typing one that happens to match is the same as deleting the check.
//
// Note what is NOT in SHELL and therefore not in the hash: sw.js itself. A
// worker does not precache itself, which is also the only reason this can be
// computed at all — and the only reason `npm run stamp` can write to this file
// without moving the target it just measured.
const SHELL_STAMP = '54a44e4777a7';

// The stamp is the version. Keeping the 'twentynine-shell-' prefix matters —
// the activate handler below deletes caches by it, and deleting by prefix is
// what stops this worker from touching a sibling project's caches on the same
// github.io origin.
const CACHE_NAME = `twentynine-shell-${SHELL_STAMP}`;

// EVERY STATIC ASSET THE SITE SERVES. Not "every module in the import graph" —
// every asset, which is a strictly larger and much easier set to check. The
// import graph is a thing you have to trace; the contents of js/ and css/ and
// icons/ are a thing you can list. scripts/test-engine.mjs asserts this list
// against what is actually on disk in both directions, so a new module that is
// added and not listed fails the suite rather than failing offline three weeks
// later on somebody's train.
//
// All paths relative, so the worker's scope — and therefore a GitHub Pages
// project subpath — is picked up automatically.
